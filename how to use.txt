this bot is extremely bare bones you need to add come commands but the command handler and event handler is full setup and ready to go 
you need to go to the 
discord.jsv13guide\src\functions
then the handleCommands.js folder and change the guild id and bot id to your own ones
looks like this
const clientId = '830645636216468'; -the bots id goes here
const guildId = '79393765754754'; -your server id goes here

you will also need a bot token to use
you need to copy the test in example.env
and make a new file called .env and paste it in ther putting your token after where it says token
you should be ready to go after this you just need to install the node modules listed down here
